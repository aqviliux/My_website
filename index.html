            Switzerland. I studied in Vilnius University in Mathematics Informatics faculty. Later I worked in a bank for
            five years. After that I decided to become a programmer and worked with SQL databases. And one day we as a family
            decided to come to Switzerland and check - is it as nice as we hear ;) </p>
