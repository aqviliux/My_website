        <h2>Psychopsis Mariposa Peloric</h2>
        <br />
        <img class="orch-img" src="./images/IMG_8674.JPG" alt="One of them" />
        <h3>Psychopsis Mariposa Peloric care </h3>
        <p class="info-orch">Commonly nick-named the 'Giraffe Orchid', or Mariposa orchid (butterfly) Psychopsis are fantastic orchids that produce
            flowers one after another on the same spike for 10-15 years. Never cut the flower spikes even if you should accidentally
            break one as they can branch below the break and continue to flower. The flowers last about three weeks before
            falling off and within another three weeks or so, another bud forms and repeats the process. Water as the potting
            mix approaches dryness or just dries out. Grow as you would for a Phalaenopsis. this is particular variety is
            the peloric form in which the petals have taken up the shape and size of the lip. This easy to grow and flower
            plant will provide years of enjoyment. Use clean water low in mineral content for best results. Do not use softened
            water as it contains salt.

        <h2>Angraecum germinyanum</h2>
        <br />
        <img class="orch-img" src="./images/IMG_7965.JPG" alt="One of them" />
        <h3>Angraecum germinyanum care</h3>
        <p class="info-orch">A higher elevation Madagascar species from a cloud forest environment that has a pendulous growth habit, and shiny,
            smooth leaves. The non-resupinate flowers have beautiful spidery petals offset neatly by the round somewhat large
            disc shaped lip. The flowers have an excellent fragrance at night. These plants do best at cool to intermediate
            temps and once they start flowering many spikes can be produced over a period of several months. Very easy to
            grow and flower!</p>

        <h2>Coelogyne usitana</h2>
        <br />
        <img class="orch-img" src="./images/IMG_8014.JPG" alt="One of them" />
        <h3>Coelogyne usitana care</h3>
        <p class="info-orch">Perhaps one of the most beautiful of the Coelogyne with white flowers and a chocolate-red lip. Fragrant. From the
            Philippines. Described recently in 2001. Up to 20-inch flower spikes with 10 to 20 flowers. This blooms off and
            on throughout the year. The flower spikes arch and hang downwards and produce a number of flowers over several
            weeks one at a time. It is not unusual for the older leaves to be dying back as the newest growths flower.</p>

        <h3>Rth. Shinfong Little Sun ‘Youngmin Golden Boy’ care</h3>

            requires living room temperature.
